We know that we have Lucene version collision and that the plugin doesn\u0027t even start.\n\nAs discussed on dev ML we have two options:\n\n* Make plugin work based on patched 1.3 version of gitblit: replace Lucene with 4.8.1 to match Lucene Version in Gerrit or remove Lucene search from gitblit entirely.\n* Upgrade plugin to latest gitblit 1.7 version\n\nThe option that we don\u0027t have is to release another broken version of this plugin.",
