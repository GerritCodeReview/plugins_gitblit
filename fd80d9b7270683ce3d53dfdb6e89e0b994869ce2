In my tests, visiting a project summary page in GitBlit still created the tickets/lucene directory, containing one file named write.lock.\n\nAppears to be caused by https://github.com/gitblit/gitblit/blob/develop/src/main/java/com/gitblit/wicket/pages/RepositoryPage.java#L339\n\nProbably a binding for ITicketServiceProvider is needed, too.\n\nMoreover, that tickets directory was created at $GERRIT_SITE/tickets, which is not good. A plugin should not mess with $GERRIT_SITE.",
